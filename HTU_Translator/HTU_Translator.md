## Translator Panel
Translator Panel located in the bottom part of the window in translator mode
The main idea of the UI is to minimalize the need to use mouse so the translator's hands can stay on the keyboard.

The third row contains profile and preset manager that will be discussed in [the next part](#profile and preset)
Let's focus on the second row where we get:


- Prefix : Automatically add fixed prefix.
- Suffix : Automatically add fixed suffix.
- Colour Code : Pick colour for the colour code.
- Colour Toggle : Toggle to put in colour code.
- Info Board : This is where you can put in extra info on the stream you're translating.
- Editor Mode : Change to editor mode.

1. Just set the prefix, suffix, and the other profile setting, enter your message and press "Enter Button" or just press enter on your keyboard.
